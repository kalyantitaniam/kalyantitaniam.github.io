**************************************************
POC Installation with Secrets in Local File System
**************************************************

You must install all components required to run Titaniam Server on a single machine or VM in a POC layout. However, only one instance of each component is installed, and therefore there is no built-in redundancy. The POC layout is suitable for development, functional evaluation, QA, and so on. However, this layout is not ideal for running production environments. And it is also not a realistic setup for performance testing or benchmarking. This POC layout includes:

* Supplying license, encryption keys, and application properties using a local file system.

Titaniam Server Artifacts
=========================

You will need the following artifacts:
   
* Docker Compose template (Copy from :ref:`docker-compose.yml <titaniam_file_server>`)

* Titaniam Properties File (Copy from :ref:`Titaniam Properties <titaniam_all_props>`)

* Keyring.json (see :ref:`keygen2`)

You will need to obtain the following from Titaniam Support:

* License file and SHA Checksum

* Titaniam docker images are available in a private repository in Docker Hub. You need an access token to download the images. Contact Titaniam support to get your access token.
