#. (Optional) Specify **Application tags**.
#. Select Docker for the Platform.

#. Leave the platform version preselected as 3.4.8 (Recommended).

#. Set a unique **Version Label**, choose **Local File**, then select **Choose file** button to browse for the downloaded file in the previous step. You should see a File successfully uploaded message.
#. Select **Create Application**. It may take a few minutes for Beanstalk to launch your environment. If the launch is successful, you will see a see a large green checkmark and the Health status displayed in green.
#. Test your environment by selecting the domain link next to your application name at the top of the dashboard.
