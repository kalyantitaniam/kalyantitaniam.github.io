Step 5: Make Service Available Outside the Cluster
==================================================

You must ensure that the Titaniam Server service is accessible outside the kubernetes cluster. To do this, you must create a service for Titaniam Server in the kubernetes cluster. To configure the service, use the ``spectra-service.yaml`` file.

#. Specify the port in the ``port`` field.
#. Specify the service name. This service name must match the one you mentioned in the ``spectra-configmap.yaml`` file.

Following is a sample ``spectra-service.yaml`` file.

..  literalinclude:: ../../common/_static/spectra-service.yml
    :language: yaml
